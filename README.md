# Rinder 

The purpose of this project is to make a one-stop solution for finding the desired reading or research partner, sell
their own products, and also be a tutor. Rinder will allow people to search for their preferable reading partner
quicker and more efficiently based on course, department, batch, and many more. Rinder is a university-based
initiative. It will have a search by location option. But the location will only cover the university area. It will
be available for all the students of that specific university. People with that university ID can sign up and use
it further.
